# Proof of work blockchain ecosystem implementation in Rust

To expand my **understanding**, **intuition** and improve my experience working with blockchain, I decided to built an entire **cryptocurrency ecosystem** from scratch.

## Mining process
The mining process works similarly to the cryptocurrency commonly known as Bitcoin, where each block should take *x* amount of time. If it takes less the required **difficulty** for the following block **increases**.

## Functionality
My app allows you to **send**, **receive** transactions, **mine blocks** or **view** the active **blockchain**.

## Building
You can test it out yourself by building and running it using **cargo run** in at least two terminal sessions.
